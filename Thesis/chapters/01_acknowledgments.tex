\chapter*{\centering Acknowledgments}

I'd like to thank Roman Prokofyev and Philippe Cudr\'e-Mauroux for their continuous support and guidance in completing this thesis. They have shown a lot of patience and have constantly supported me with feedback, new ideas and resources. It would not have been possible to complete the thesis without their support.

I'd also like to thank my loving wife and my family for continuously pushing me and giving me the space, time and support to complete the thesis.
