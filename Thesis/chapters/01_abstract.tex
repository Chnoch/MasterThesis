\section{Abstract}

In this thesis we apply different techniques of machine learning to a real life dataset, gathered anonymously from users of an Android app that collects data about the stations the user has passed. Our goal is to best predict the next station that the user is going to, based on information that would be available to us in the moment. Such information could include time, day, current location, past locations.

We show ways to analyze and optimize the raw data, prepare and filter it in a way that yields the best results for further analysis. We compare different machine learning algorithms on our dataset and discuss the advantages and disadvantages that we encountered with each algorithm. We then present the experiments that we did on our dataset and evaluate the results and predictions from the algorithms to draw conclusions to the reliability and the meaningfulness of our approaches. We further discuss what future work should or could be done to take advantage of the techniques that we explored in our thesis.
